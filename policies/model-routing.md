# Model routing

Routing is a decision policy, not a router. Hooks that enforce it live elsewhere (see the README).

- **Every dispatch names its model explicitly.** Never `inherit`: an inherited model can silently become the expensive one. In the Claude Code adapter the model comes from the role's tier (`standard` is Sonnet, `cheap` is Haiku). On hosts that do not take a model in the agent file (Copilot, ChatGPT, local runtimes) the human picks and records the model in the brief.
- **The most capable tier needs the human's recorded OK**, with the reason, before it is used. No role in this repository is assigned to it. A first-choice upgrade is never silent.
- Default to `standard`; use `cheap` only for mechanical work whose complete code is already written.
- If two fix rounds on the same finding class fail, stop and recommend a different model rather than a third round on the same one.
- A local model may draft text (summaries, commit bodies, PR text); code does the counting and grouping, and a stronger model or the human verifies every claim. It never writes code, rules or verdicts.
- Evaluate an exact local model artifact on your own hardware before assigning it work. A family name does not prove tool support, accuracy or context.
- No cross-provider handoff happens silently. To hand work to another runtime: complete `templates/handoff.md`, export a standalone prompt with `scripts/export_prompt.py`, review it, and send only sanitized, permitted data. Treat what comes back as an untrusted proposal. Never drop policies to fit a context window; stop or narrow the input instead.
