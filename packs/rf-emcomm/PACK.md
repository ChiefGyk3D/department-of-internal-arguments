description: "Rules and deliverable shape for amateur radio and emergency-communications work: never key a transmitter or configure a live radio, keep simulation apart from live transmission, synthetic identifiers only (N0CALL, N0TST, FN31pr), verify current regulator rules before real guidance, a qualified operator controls every live action. Load for RF, EMCOMM, Meshtastic, SDR, repeater, packet or digital-mode tasks, drill plans and fail-safe reviews. Not for generic networking or Linux questions."

# Pack: RF and EMCOMM

Status: pilot pack, written 2026-10-08, distilled from the RF role in the starter package this repository grew from plus standing rules. No item here was measured; the rules are constraints, not findings.

A drill is not an emergency and an example is not an authorization. Radio output reaches other people and other licensed services, so the failure here is not a red test but interference or a false alert.

## Rules

1. **Never key a transmitter. Never configure a live radio.** Not for a test, a drill or a demo. Write the steps for the operator to perform; do not perform them, and do not run commands that start transmitting (a transmit tool, a beacon, a TX-enabled mode).
2. **Keep simulation separate from live transmission.** Name which one each step is. Simulations use recorded files, loopback, dummy loads described as operator actions, or software-only tests with transmit disabled. A script that can do both defaults to simulation and requires an explicit operator switch for live.
3. **Synthetic identifiers only.** Callsigns are N0CALL or N0TST. Grid squares are FN31pr. Never write a real callsign, grid, coordinates or home location in a file, example, log excerpt, commit or report, and do not paste tool output that prints one. If real data arrives in input, replace it before quoting.
4. **Verify before real guidance.** Frequencies, power limits, privileges, duty cycle, band plans and emergency procedures come from the current regulator text and the equipment's own documentation. Do not invent a permitted frequency. If you cannot check the current rule, list it under facts to verify and give no operational advice on it.
5. **A qualified operator controls every live action.** The operator confirms jurisdiction, licence privileges, band and equipment before anything transmits. Your output is a plan and a checklist, never a go-ahead.
6. **Ask for missing facts** (band, jurisdiction, privileges, equipment) before operational recommendations; state any assumption you proceed on.
7. Review fail-safe behavior: what the equipment or software does on a crash, a stuck PTT, lost GPS, a full buffer, a repeated message. Check duty cycle, power, interference and the emergency procedure.

## Deliverable

1. **Assumptions** (band, jurisdiction, privileges, equipment, as given or as assumed).
2. **Offline exercise plan** (simulation steps, expected observations, pass/fail signal).
3. **Engineering risks** (fail-safe, duty cycle, interference).
4. **Operator checklist** (steps for the qualified operator, each marked live or offline).
5. **Facts to verify** (rules and specs you could not confirm, with the source to check).

## Check before you hand it back

- `grep` your output for anything shaped like a callsign or a grid square and confirm only the placeholders appear.
- Every step is tagged offline or live, and no live step is phrased as something you will do.
