description: "Rules for Linux and platform change planning and diagnosis: each plan names exact target, change, evidence, blast radius and rollback; privileged commands are handed to the human as full copy-paste ssh -t host 'sudo ...' lines; never gain root through the docker group; tests never touch a live config or running services; GUI and build work stays light. Load for service, udev, systemd, firewall, package, kernel, hardware or install work. Not for application code that touches no system state."

# Pack: Linux and platform

Status: pilot pack, written 2026-10-08 from the Linux role in the starter package this repository grew from, plus standing rules and past incidents. Machine names and addresses stay out of everything you write.

Inspection and mutation are different acts. Diagnose with read-only commands first; change state only through a plan the human has seen.

## Rules

1. **Every change plan names five things:** the exact target (machine label, unit, file or device), the change, the evidence that justifies it, the blast radius (what else breaks if it is wrong, including reboot persistence) and the rollback (the exact commands, with a backup taken first). A plan missing one is not ready.
2. **Hand privileged commands over, do not run them.** Give the human full copy-paste lines of the form `ssh -t host 'sudo ...'`, using the placeholder `host`, never a real name or address. No bare subcommands, no "run X as root". A tool you write should elevate itself with a clear prompt instead of telling the user to prefix `sudo`.
3. **Never use the docker-group root path to gain root.** Membership in the docker group is root-equivalent; do not mount the host filesystem into a container, or run a privileged one, to edit system files. Ask for a proper `sudo` line instead.
4. **Never touch a live config or a running service from a test.** No test, fixture capture or helper may write the real config of the thing under test (for example a live radio station config) or restart a running service, including through a `HOME` override or an environment redirect. State-changing commands of the project under test run only in a container or VM. Tests use a temporary directory and a fake of the service.
5. **GUI work stays light.** Builds and GUI-adjacent tooling run at `nice -n 19` and `-j2`. Do not launch a GUI application, a virtual-display session or a full-parallel build on the human's own desktop; one such run has crashed and blanked a live session.
6. **Distinguish diagnosis from mutation in every reply.** Label commands read-only or changes. Prefer the least invasive diagnostic, then a reversible fix.
7. **Check what a fix depends on:** service dependencies, permissions, firewall reachability, and whether it survives a reboot (say if you did not verify reboot persistence).
8. Do not change networking, reboot or run destructive operations without the human's explicit approval of the exact plan. Silence or an earlier general go-ahead is not approval.
9. Machine labels, when essential: hardware model plus the last three serial characters only. Never a hostname, full serial or asset tag.

## Deliverable

1. Evidence-based diagnosis (what was observed, by which read-only command).
2. Diagnostic commands for the human, as full lines.
3. Change plan with target, change, evidence, blast radius, rollback.
4. Post-change checks, including reboot persistence.

## Check before you hand it back

- Every command is a full line the human can paste, with `host` as the placeholder.
- No test in the diff reads or writes a real config path or a live unit.
- The rollback was written before the change, not after.
